The wind carried a scent no one could name, a faint mixture of burnt sugar, ozone, and something that felt like nostalgia pressed into a bottle. In the middle of the courtyard, a marble fountain sang without water, producing a melody that only certain ears could hear. Marlowe adjusted his coat, not because it was cold, but because the air itself seemed to demand ceremony. The tiles beneath his feet shifted subtly, rearranging into patterns that resembled constellations from a sky no telescope had yet mapped.

High above, a flock of transparent birds wheeled in perfect spirals, casting shadows where their bodies should have been. Each turn of their wings sent ripples through the clouds, revealing glimpses of cities floating between dimensions. Somewhere far off, bells tolled thirteen times, though no clock in this realm recognized such an hour. People in long coats and mirrored masks passed through the square, exchanging envelopes sealed with wax that glowed faintly from within. Nobody spoke aloud; even the children whispered in a language that shimmered like heat haze.

A market stretched beyond the fountain, stalls covered in velvet and copper. Vendors sold bottled storms, clockwork animals, and memory seeds that sprouted visions when planted in soil. One stand displayed a pile of silver keys with no locks to claim them, each humming with the promise of an unopened door. Marlowe paused at a table where a woman in a violet hat offered him a small black cube. “It contains the last sunset of the world,” she said, though her lips never moved. He declined politely, feeling the weight of unasked questions press against his ribs.

Further along, an alley curved in on itself, forming an impossible loop. A man with ink-stained hands sat there, painting doors onto the brick walls. Some of them opened to reveal staircases leading upward into the sky, while others showed roaring oceans trapped behind thin layers of air. As Marlowe watched, one painted door began to leak sand that smelled faintly of cinnamon. The man simply nodded as if to say, “It’s best not to ask.”

By the time he reached the edge of the city, the ground had given way to a field of black glass, reflecting an inverted landscape where the moon was burning and the sun hung frozen in place. In the distance, a single tower spiraled upward, built entirely from fragments of broken mirrors. They reflected not Marlowe himself, but a hundred possible versions of him — some laughing, some crying, some holding objects he had never seen before.

He took a step forward, and the reflections stepped with him, each slightly out of sync. Somewhere deep inside, a thought bloomed: perhaps the tower was not a destination, but a question. And perhaps the answer was already walking toward him from the other side of the glass.
